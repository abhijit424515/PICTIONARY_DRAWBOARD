## Features and gameplay

- A page for players to create private lobbies, where they can share invite CODES to other players.
<!-- - After players join into a lobby, they have to choose one of the given 2 sides.
- Each player is given a catapult of their own, whose angle and orientation can be controlled by that player. Also, each team is given a base behind them to defend.
- The players have to use their keyboard to control the aim of their catapult and destroy either the enemy base or the enemy catapults by throwing projectiles using the catapult.
- Each hit awards certain points to each player, and each receiving hit by a catapult reduces the health of the catapult.
- The game ends when either the enemy castle, or all the enemy catapults are destroyed.
- After the game ends, a scoreboard showing the points of all players will be displayed in descending order. -->

### Additional features (if time permits)

- Quick chat **(emojis)**
